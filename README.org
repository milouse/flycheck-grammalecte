#+title: Flycheck-grammalecte

Integrate the french grammar and typography checker [[http://www.dicollecte.org/][Grammalecte]] with
[[http://www.flycheck.org/][flycheck]] to automatically look for mistakes in your writings. It also
provides an easy way to find synonyms and antonyms for a given word (to
avoid repetitions for exemple). This package is of very little interest
for other languages.

* Installation

[[https://stable.melpa.org/#/flycheck-grammalecte][file:https://stable.melpa.org/packages/flycheck-grammalecte-badge.svg]]

[[https://melpa.org/#/flycheck-grammalecte][file:https://melpa.org/packages/flycheck-grammalecte-badge.svg]]

This package has a strong dependency on ~python3~. The installation of
the right version of python is up to you.

/Flycheck grammalecte/ is available on MELPA stable and unstable. Please
read the [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InstallingPackages][Installing Package documentation]] from the EmacsWiki to know
more how to install a package. A [[./MANUAL_INSTALL.org][manual installation procedure]] exists
too if you prefer.

To enable it, simply add the following line somewhere in your GNU Emacs
config file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (with-eval-after-load 'flycheck
    (flycheck-grammalecte-setup))
#+end_src

Finally, the last expected step is to download the
[[https://grammalecte.net/#download][CLI & Server upstream package]]. Just enter the following command:
~M-x grammalecte-download-grammalecte~

* Usage

Enable /flycheck/ in a buffer, which major mode is declared in
~flycheck-grammalecte-enabled-modes~, and voilà!

To correct a word or expression at point, you can use the command
~flycheck-grammalecte-correct-error-at-point~, which is bind to
~C-c ! g~ by default[fn:1]. You can also right-click on it and a menu
will popup to let you choose the better correction.

If you are looking for a better word at some place, you can use the
function ~flycheck-grammalecte-find-synonyms-at-point~ (which will take
the word at point to find synonyms and antonyms) or the simpler
~flycheck-grammalecte-find-synonyms~ (which will ask you for a word
before doing the search). Pro tip: these functions are available even in
buffer, which major mode is not in the
~flycheck-grammalecte-enabled-modes~ list.

[fn:1] In fact, it is bind only to ~g~ in the ~flycheck-command-map~,
       ~C-c !~ being the flycheck default prefix.

* Configuration

** Generic way

All options are accessibles with ~customize~. In GNU Emacs, enter
~M-x customize~, then click on ~Editing~, then ~I18n~, and finally on
~Flycheck Grammalecte~.

You can also set these variables in your GNU Emacs config
file. Configuration must occurs *before* calling
~flycheck-grammalecte-setup~. In that case, don't forget to first
require ~flycheck-grammalecte~ to prefill its variables. For exemple:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (with-eval-after-load 'flycheck
    (setq flycheck-grammalecte-report-esp nil)
    (require 'flycheck-grammalecte)
    (add-to-list 'flycheck-grammalecte-enabled-modes 'fountain-mode)
    (grammalecte-download-grammalecte)
    (flycheck-grammalecte-setup))
#+end_src

Here is a quick reference of the available variables:

- ~flycheck-grammalecte-report-spellcheck~ :: If this variable is set to
     ~nil~, Flycheck will *not* report spellchecking error. Only grammar
     errors will be notified. ~nil~ is the default value as you should
     better use /flyspell/ or /ispell/.
- ~flycheck-grammalecte-report-grammar~ :: If this variable is set to
     ~nil~, Flycheck will *not* report grammar error. Only spellchecking
     errors will be notified. Default is ~t~.
- ~flycheck-grammalecte-report-apos~ :: If this variable is set to
     ~nil~, Flycheck will *not* report typographical apostrophes (’)
     error. This can be usefull when your main editor mode manage
     apostrophe by itself (like LaTeX, org-mode export…). Default is
     ~t~.
- ~flycheck-grammalecte-report-nbsp~ :: If this variable is set to
     ~nil~, Flycheck will *not* report non-breakable spaces
     error. This can be usefull when your main editor mode manage
     spaces by itself (like LaTeX, org-mode export…). Default is ~t~.
- ~flycheck-grammalecte-report-esp~ :: If this variable is set to
     ~nil~, Flycheck will *not* report useless spaces and tabs error.
     This can be usefull when your main editor mode manage spaces by
     itself (like LaTeX, org-mode export…). Default is ~t~.
- ~flycheck-grammalecte-enabled-modes~ :: This variable stores the list
     of major modes for which /flycheck-grammalecte/ must be
     used. Default is ~'(latex-mode mail-mode markdown-mode message-mode
     mu4e-compose-mode org-mode text-mode)~.
     To add markdown mode use the following line for exemple:
     ~(add-to-list 'flycheck-grammalecte-enabled-modes 'fountain-mode)~
- ~flycheck-grammalecte-filters~ :: Patterns for which errors in
     matching texts are ignored. See its documentation for
     details. There is also a ~flycheck-grammalecte~filters-by-mode~
     variable, which allow to enable filters only for a given mode.

** With ~use-package~

Here is the minimal working configuration:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package flycheck-grammalecte
               :config (flycheck-grammalecte-setup))
#+end_src

However, you may want to configure it a little more, and be sure the
Grammalecte python package is always here. Thus the following example
illustrates a more complete scenario. In that one, please take note how the
~flycheck-grammalecte-enabled-modes~ is customized in the ~:config~ section
instead of the ~:init~ section, to be sure the package has been loaded and
thus the list already exists.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package flycheck-grammalecte
               :hook (fountain-mode . flycheck-mode)
               :init
               (setq flycheck-grammalecte-report-apos nil
                     flycheck-grammalecte-report-esp nil
                     flycheck-grammalecte-report-nbsp nil)
               :config
               (add-to-list 'flycheck-grammalecte-enabled-modes 'fountain-mode)
               (grammalecte-download-grammalecte)
               (flycheck-grammalecte-setup))
#+end_src


** Breaking changes

*** Version 2.0

This version comes with a big refactoring, separating Flycheck only stuff from
other usefull functions in two different lisp packages: ~flycheck-grammalecte~
and ~grammalecte~. A long list of variables and functions, which were
previously prefixed by ~flycheck-grammalecte-~ are now prefixed with
~grammalecte-~ and have been moved in a dedicated file. Here is the list of
the most common ones you may already have interacted with:

- variables:
  + ~flycheck-grammalecte--debug-mode~ renamed as ~grammalecte--debug-mode~
  + ~flycheck-grammalecte--directory~ renamed as ~grammalecte--site-directory~
  + ~flycheck-grammalecte-grammalecte-directory~ renamed as ~grammalecte-python-package-directory~
  + ~flycheck-grammalecte-download-without-asking~ renamed as ~grammalecte-download-without-asking~
  + ~flycheck-grammalecte-mode-map~ renamed as ~grammalecte-mode-map~
- functions:
  + ~flycheck-grammalecte--grammalecte-version~ renamed as ~grammalecte--version~
  + ~flycheck-grammalecte--grammalecte-upstream-version~ renamed as ~grammalecte--upstream-version~
  + ~flycheck-grammalecte-kill-ring-save~ renamed as ~grammalecte-kill-ring-save~
  + ~flycheck-grammalecte-save-and-replace~ renamed as ~grammalecte-save-and-replace~
  + ~flycheck-grammalecte-define~ renamed as ~grammalecte-define~
  + ~flycheck-grammalecte-define-at-point~ renamed as ~grammalecte-define-at-point~
  + ~flycheck-grammalecte-find-synonyms~ renamed as ~grammalecte-find-synonyms~
  + ~flycheck-grammalecte-find-synonyms-at-point~ renamed as ~grammalecte-find-synonyms-at-point~
  + ~flycheck-grammalecte-conjugate-verb~ renamed as ~grammalecte-conjugate-verb~
  + ~flycheck-grammalecte-download-grammalecte~ renamed as ~grammalecte-download-grammalecte~

*** Version 1.0

As you may have noticed, the most important change is the introduction
of the function ~flycheck-grammalecte-setup~, which didn't exist
before. If you don't add it to your init file, the checker won't be
added to Flycheck checkers list and will never start. Thus, you are
required now to add the following line *after* your customization to
this package:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (flycheck-grammalecte-setup)
#+end_src

*** Version 0.9

This version changes the default value of
~flycheck-grammalecte-report-spellcheck~ to ~nil~, making now
grammalecte to *not* report spellchecking errors. If you like the old
behavior, you are now required to explicitely set this variable to ~t~.
